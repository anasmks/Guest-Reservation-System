# Guest-Reservation-System

Guest-Reservation-System is a simple java based console application... 

The guest reservation system we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to make, view, and cancel reservations.

We will use the following components to build the system: Reservation Class, Reservation System Class and User Interface.

We will discuss about each class and its functionality. Reservation class will represent a reservation and will have properties like name, date, and number of guests.

For taking the inputs from user, we have used the scanner class. In while loop all the options have been mentioned as â€“ Make a reservation, view all reservations, Cancel a reservation and Exit.
